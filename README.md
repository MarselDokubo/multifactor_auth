## Readme File for Multifactor Authentication Project

### Project Overview

This project implements a multifactor authentication (MFA) system using a combination of password-based authentication, email verification, and time-based one-time passwords (TOTP). It leverages the following technologies:

- **Node.js:** Server-side runtime environment
- **Express:** Web framework
- **Mongoose:** MongoDB ODM
- **Passport:** Authentication middleware
- **Passport-Local:** Strategy for local authentication
- **bcryptjs:** Password hashing
- **jsonwebtoken:** JWT token generation and verification
- **dotenv:** Environment variable management
- **cors:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **express-session:** Session management
- **qrcode:** QR code generation
- **speakeasy:** TOTP generation

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/multifactor_auth.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Create a `.env` file:**
   Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

### Running the Project

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Usage

**User Registration:**

1. Send a POST request to `/register` with the user's email, password, and desired username.
2. The system will generate a verification email sent to the provided email address.
3. The user must click on the verification link in the email to activate their account.

**User Login:**

1. Send a POST request to `/login` with the user's email and password.
2. If the credentials are correct, the system will generate a JWT token and send it back in the response.

**TOTP Setup:**

1. Send a POST request to `/totp/setup` with the user's email.
2. The system will generate a QR code and send it to the user.
3. The user can scan the QR code with a TOTP app (e.g., Google Authenticator) to set up TOTP.

**Login with TOTP:**

1. Send a POST request to `/login/totp` with the user's email, password, and TOTP code.
2. If the credentials and TOTP code are correct, the system will generate a JWT token and send it back in the response.

### API Endpoints

- **`/register`:** Register a new user
- **`/login`:** Log in a user
- **`/totp/setup`:** Set up TOTP for a user
- **`/login/totp`:** Log in a user using TOTP

### Additional Notes

- **Security:** Ensure proper password hashing, secure storage of sensitive information, and regular security updates.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to provide informative feedback to users.
- **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **Customization:** Feel free to customize the project to fit your specific requirements, such as adding additional authentication factors or integrating with other systems.
